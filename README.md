# Minor Project One: Password Cracking Lab 

## Project Description
This project demonstrates how weak passwords can be cracked using common password cracking methods such as dictionary attacks and brute-force attacks.

##  Goals
- Understand how password hashing concepts work
- Perform common password cracking methods
- Measure time taken to crack different passwords
- Understand the importance of strong passwords

## Tools Used
1. Kali Linux  
2. Oracle VirtualBox  
3. Hashcat  
4. John the Ripper  

## Environment Setup
- Oracle VirtualBox is used to run Kali Linux in an isolated environment.
- For safety and ethical reasons, all experiments are performed only inside Kali Linux using dummy data.
