# Minor Project One: Password Cracking Lab 

## Project Description
This project demonstrates how weak passwords can be cracked using common password cracking methods such as dictionary attacks and brute-force attacks.

##  Goals
- Understand how password hashing concepts work
- Perform common password cracking methods
- Measure time taken to crack different passwords
- Understand the importance of strong passwords

## Tools Used
1. Kali Linux  
2. Oracle VirtualBox  
3. Hashcat  
4. John the Ripper  

## Environment Setup
- Oracle VirtualBox is used to run Kali Linux in an isolated environment.
- For safety and ethical reasons, all experiments are performed only inside Kali Linux using dummy data.

---

## Day 1 Progress

### Tasks Completed
- Installed Oracle VirtualBox on Windows
- Downloaded and imported Kali Linux virtual machine
- Successfully logged into Kali Linux
- Set up shared folder between Windows and Kali for file transfer

## Day 2:Kali Linux basics and project preparation

### tasks completed:
  - Practiced basic Kali linux terminal commands like pwd,mkdir,rm etc.
  - verified rockyou.txt wordlist for dictionary attacks.
  - checked version and availability of Hashcat and John the Ripper.

### Brief description
 - **Day 2 was focused on understanding the kali linux environment and preparing system for password cracking experiments.**
 - Basic linux terminal commands like pwd,ls,mkdir,sudo were practiced to familiarize with kali linux operating system and understand file navigation.
 - availability of essential password cracking tools were checked and updated to ensure proper tool configuration.
 - Additionally, built-in wordlists like **rockyou.txt** required for dictionary attack were located and verified.

 **Day-2 mainly focused on building familiarity with operating environment and tools before performing actual password cracking experiments.**

## Day 3:dummy password and Hash generation
### tasks completed:
  - list of dummy passwords with different strength levels were created.
  - generated MD5 hashes for each password created.
 
### Brief Description:
On Day 3, dummy passwords were created and converted into MD5 hashes to simulate real-world password storage. These hashes were prepared for further cracking experiments using security tools.
